Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.


formula : |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|

solution

select round(abs(a-c)+abs(b-d),4) as main
from (select
     (select min(lat_n) from station) as a,
     (select min(long_w) from station) as b,
     (select max(lat_n) from station) as c,
     (select max(long_w) from station) as d
     ) as subquery;
