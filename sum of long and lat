1. Query the following two values from the STATION table:

The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.

SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),2), ROUND(SUM(LONG_W),2)  FROM STATION;

2. Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION
 that is less than 137.2345.
 Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.

SOLUTION

select ROUND(MAX(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N<137.2345;
