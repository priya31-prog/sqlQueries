Consider p1(a,c) and p2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where
(a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude 
(LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of 
Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points p1 and p2  and
format your answer to display  decimal digits.

solution

select round(sqrt(power((a-b),2)+ power((c-d),2)),4) as result 
from(
    select
    (select min(lat_n) from station) as a,
    (select max(lat_n) from station) as b,
    (select min(long_w) from station) as c,
    (select max(long_w) from station) as d
)as subquery;
